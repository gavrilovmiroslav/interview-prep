# One bit difference

Given two integers, write a function to determine whether or not their binary representations differ by a single bit.

Example:

```scala
 gray(0, 1) = true 		// 0000 vs 0001 -- differs in the first bit
 gray(1, 2) = false		// 0001 vs 0010 -- differs in the first and second bit
```
